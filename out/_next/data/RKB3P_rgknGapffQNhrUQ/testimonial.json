I have no hesitation in recommending these guys and will definitely use them again","t_image":"dummypic.jpg"},{"t_author":"Marc Hardy","t_message":"Have dealt with these guys for a number of years in a professional capacity.

Please sift through the BS and judge them based on their merits.","t_image":"photo.png"},{"t_author":"Lisa Hearn","t_message":"Absolutely recommended!!
